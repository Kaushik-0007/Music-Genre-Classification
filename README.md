# Music-Genre-Classification

Welcome to the Music Genre Classification Challenge! This competition invites data enthusiasts and machine learning experts to harness the power of machine learning to classify music genres. The dataset provided consists of audio features extracted from 3-second audio clips, along with corresponding genre labels. Participants will build machine learning models to accurately classify the music genres of these clips.

The dataset is a collection of audio features, carefully curated and preprocessed for the competition. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a 3-second audio clip. The features include acoustic attributes such as tempo, MFCCs, spectral characteristics, and more. Additionally, the dataset includes genre labels for each audio clip, enabling participants to build classification models.

This is a classification problem, given 3 seconds of music clips, we have extracted key features of the audio clips and presented you with 60 unique features for each clip. Use these features to train a classification model that has a baseline accuracy of 70%.
